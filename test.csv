Roku is the #1 TV streaming platform in the US, and we’ve set our sights on powering every television in the world. Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.

From your first day at Roku, you’ll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We’re a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.

Data may or may not be the new oil, but it sure is essential to a company like ours.

About The Role

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV and continues to innovate and lead the industry. While we are well-positioned to help shape the future of television – including TV advertising – around the world, continued success relies on its investment in our data.

At Roku, data is at the center of everything we do. At Roku’s scale, the depth and richness of our data help us uncover insights to improve our users' everyday experience. That’s why we’re actively looking for a Data Scientist (University Grad) to leverage big data, generating the insights that fuel Roku’s most significant business decisions to play an instrumental role within the Devices & CoreOS product analytics team.

Data Scientists use a combination of technical skills, business intuition, and analytical thinking to partner with business stakeholders and provide actionable recommendations. We expect you to play an instrumental role in helping Roku to continue its success by providing insightful segmentation, analysis of platform and behavioral trends, and A|B testing. More than having strong technical abilities to retrieve, manipulate, analyze, and visualize data and excellent communication capabilities. One of the key requirements of the role is to collaborate with stakeholders and satisfies immediate business needs. The Data Scientists role at Roku is a perfect fit for anyone who wants to continue to evolve business domain expertise alongside technical and analytical development.

As a Data Scientist (University Grad), you’ll be expected to look at what exists and find ways to make it better. We’re always in “build mode” because we’re a company of data-focused builders, especially on the data team.

What You’ll Be Doing

Use Roku’s enriched datasets to perform thorough analyses
Assist new product launches
Develop data visualizations that illustrate complex platform phenomena using Looker, Tableau, etc.
Partner with leadership, engineers, product managers, and data engineers to understand business needs and how these can be addressed through analytics
Use creativity to find proxies where verbatim data or measurement is unavailable
Identify new applications for the myriad logged events in Roku’s immense data catalog

We’re excited if you have

Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Analytics, earned in Spring 2022, or no earlier than Spring 2021
Command of SQL and experience working with Big Data
Experience in R or Python
A/B test experience

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The Future Talent Program features internships that lasts up to 12 weeks and will include one or more projects. These opportunities in our Research & Development Division can provide you with great development and a chance to see if we are the right company for your long-term goals.




Emerging advanced deep learning models have demonstrated great potential in synthesizing information from multiple sources to guide decision-making and optimize resources allocation in early discovery and preclinical study. Our company has a long history of investing in cutting edge machine learning models, with pioneered work in developing widely used public R package for random forest and internal machine learning MIX QSAR infrastructure. ML-based QSAR models are broadly adopted for rolling human dose prediction in Preclinical Development (PCD) ADME’s newly built tool Automated Dose Prediction (ADP), with the purpose of improving efficiency and capability of human dose prediction to streamline medicinal compound discovery throughout ROP.




While in-silico QSAR models are being updated quarterly, ADME PIs continue to notice a frustrating discrepancy between experimental measurements and QSAR predictions for animals and human cell models, with an interesting observation that measured animal data better characterize new animal species and human cell models than QSAR models do in many programs. This discrepancy and observation point to a great opportunity of improving accuracy of predictive models for translational study in preclinical stage. With the release of scientific data consumption platform (SDCP), we are now able to access all in-vitro and in-vivo data from decades of PCD research. Building new advanced deep learning based predictive models from in-silico, in-vitro, and in-vivo data for translational study has immediate impact in improving human dose prediction accuracy and, furthermore, enables the acceleration of early discovery.




The intern will be expected to experiment with advanced deep learning methods on multiple different predictive tasks closely tied to PCD research and packaged up developed models to work as foundational building blocks for future PCD data science products.




Primary Objectives




Gather and clean data from SDCP for each task.
Explore internal and external software and platforms to develop a cloud-based (AWS or Databricks) model development platform.
Dive deep into new deep learning methods published in recent years and carry out experiments on multiple tasks.
Study domain applicability of new models and characterize model performance by comparing with current models.




Benefits To The Group




Foundational building block for data science products in PCD and across Discovery, Preclinical, and Translational Medicine (DPTM).
Improve dose prediction accuracy in early discovery and PCD stages.
A cloud-based model development platform for PCD modelers.
More trustworthy predictions for in-vitro and in-vivo assays.




Benefits For The Intern




Opportunity to dive deep into modern deep learning technologies, including but not limited to, graphical neural network, reinforcement learning, and bidirectional transformer.
Hands on experience on learning, adapting, refining, and developing predictive models with real applications in medicinal chemistry discovery and preclinical study.
Work daily in a diverse team across our Research & Development Division on ground-breaking technologies, gaining deeper exposure to drug development.
Potential for a publication.




Required Education & Experience




Candidates must be PhD students conducting machine learning related computational research.
Candidates must be proficient in Python programming and machine learning packages, e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow.
Candidates must have a passion in drug R&D.
Candidates must be available to work full-time for 12 weeks beginning on 5JUN23

We believe that a critical aspect of doing the right thing requires building diverse, inclusive, and highly effective teams of individuals who are as unique as the clients they serve.

The working model that your role falls into will be communicated to you in the interview process – please do ask if you are unsure. We encourage you to make the decision regarding your job interview and offer knowing which model your role will fall into. We will test and learn as our ways of working evolve and will continue to evaluate working models along the way.

About This Job




Disrupting the marketplace more than 25 years ago, CarMax became the largest used car retailer in the US. However, our goals as a company aren't just to be the best in the industry but a leading retailer across all industries.

Last year alone, CarMax sold more than 1 million vehicles, appraised over 2 million vehicles, and had $150m in weekly auto auction spend - all while dealing with constantly changing consumer demand, wholesale auction supply, and other market conditions that are often regionally differentiated.




To realize the full value of our models, our systems experts must accurately and instantaneously deliver thousands of recommendations to our field associates daily. This requires the combination of a deep understanding of our models, the quantitative and technical skills to deploy new models as robust and stable systems, and the results focus and analytical ability to quickly diagnose and fix problems.

Ensure that new code deployments are stable and align with intent through unit testing
Build automated monitoring and alert systems to ensure that production models are delivering intended values
Quickly respond to and resolve pricing system issues
Partner with CarMax Technology to evolve system infrastructure to support our business and data science needs
Communicate how our systems work within and outside of the team, both at a general level and a detailed level




Qualifications And Requirements




Ability to consistently deliver at a high level on the responsibilities listed above
Degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, or related field




Requirements listed below are representative of the knowledge and skills required:




Mathematical, modeling, and reasoning skills to understand complex pricing models and deploy them accurately
Computer programming skills to integrate new models into our existing framework
Experience/familiarity with our exciting technology suite (Azure, Python, R, SQL, Teradata, etc.) and to explore new technologies to enhance our data science capabilities
Strong communication and teamwork to deliver clear and consistent messaging




Interviewing Process




Due to COVID-19, most of our employees are working from home. We've implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by phone or video. We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we're all in this together.




Upon an applicant's request, CarMax will consider reasonable accommodation to complete the CarMax Job Application.

- Work with the CTO and VP of Engineering to help normalize our data/ETL pipeline for analysis and reporting
- Come up with your own solutions/ideas and determine what types of analysis, algorithms, and approaches we could implement to improve the company
- Lead end-to-end process including conception, development, production, deployment, and monitoring of data and machine learning models and services

The existing ways to determine if somebody is who they claim to be are too clunky, ineffective, and expensive, but we believe strongly that the future will be 10x better.




We’ve had tremendous traction and are growing extremely quickly. Already our real-time APIs have helped verify hundreds of millions of identities, beginning with financial services. We’ve recently raised a $70M Series B round, led by Craft Ventures to rapidly scale our best in class products. We’ve earned coverage and awards from TechCrunch, CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Business Insider, PYMNTS, American Banker, LendIt, and others. And we’ve even been a part of history--we were the first company to go live with eCBSV and testified before the United States House of Representatives.




As a Sales Support Data Scientist at SentiLink, you will be responsible for our pushing through pilot studies. Pilot studies are the way a financial institution is introduced to our fraud score products -- by securely sharing past accounts with us, we process data, run it through our API, and quickly generate analysis to explain how much fraud SentiLink’s solutions will stop. As such, your work will be the first encounter financial institutions have with SentiLink’s products. SentiLink is growing rapidly and you will be a core component of enabling that growth.

Koda is a young Houston-based remote-friendly startup building software to help guide difficult conversations in healthcare. We’re looking to hire a Research Scientist to help facilitate our research studies.




About the product

Every day across the US somebody’s grandmother, grandfather, mom, dad or other loved one ends up getting end-of-life medical care that they don’t want (ventilation, dialysis, etc) while others don’t receive all of the care that they do want, especially in disadvantaged communities. Koda’s core product is a web-based platform implemented by leading healthcare systems, insurers and hospitals to help guide patient decision making around their end-of-life care, ensuring that everyone gets the care that they want and deserve.




About our research

At Koda, we believe it's important for our product to be rooted in research and backed by the academic community. We have received grants from the NSF and NIH to learn more about advance care planning and how we can provide appropriate care and content to patients. A significant amount of our research has been dedicated to understanding how Advance Care Planning can be made more accessible to all.




About the Job

We’re looking for a Research Scientist who is excited to improve the standard of Advance Care Planning. More on the job below:




Once acclimated, we expect you to take the lead on our research studies and be able to coordinate on all necessary tasks throughout the grant process including application process, grant reviews, keeping track of budgets, IRB protocol submissions and amendments, progress report updates, final report drafting, and publications of research findings.
You will also be responsible for communicating findings to the leadership and product development teams so that both product and patient experience might improve.
You will not be alone in this role as the company puts a significant focus on research but you will be helping coordinate and delegate responsibilities across the team where needed.
You will have the opportunity to write publications and present at conferences.
Working hours would, ideally, be 9-5 in a US timezone but we understand that different people are more productive at different times of the day– so this is flexible.
As an early research team hire, you will have a heavily-weighted say in high-level research decisions, product growth, as well as in managing future hires.







We’re looking for:

MS or PhD with 2+ years of clinical research experience
Experience writing IRB protocols and submitting amendments
Provide input on clinical research projects related to budget, timelines, scheduling, staffing, and other relevant issues
Ability to demonstrate good judgment and problem solving to troubleshoot and modify protocol implementation when necessary, including barriers to study recruitment
Coordinate with study sponsors, contractors, other PIs and research team members as part of sponsored or multi-PI studies
Ability to perform data analysis or know how to communicate with technical team to generate necessary data reports
​​Excellent written and oral skills, Windows, Microsoft Word, Excel, Access, Powerpoint, editing, and proper telephone etiquette skills are required for this position.
Fluent english
US citizen or permanent resident




As a plus:

Experience working on small teams at early stage startups




Why Koda Health

We’re working on problems which have a real impact on people’s lives. When we succeed, patients, families and clinicians are best prepared to have difficult conversations and make decisions that are aligned with the patient’s goals.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are important to us. Every team member must abide by our shared code of conduct. We believe this approach will help us attract and grow a diverse bunch of talented people that are supportive, empathetic, and results-oriented.

We’re constantly improving our systems and processes, and you’ll be expected to join in to shape this as we journey together.

We believe everyone has life and value outside of work. That’s why you’ll find us working smarter not longer and pushing each other to find balance.

We also provide great benefits to our team:

$60k-70k salary range
Unlimited PTO, ensuring you take vacations as you need
Flexible remote work
Health Benefits & 401(k) & Retirement savings programs

This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world, regardless of any location that might be specified above.]




About Quora




The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.




About The Team




Unsurprisingly, then, the Data Team is highly empowered at Quora, helping navigate complexity and influencing product and company strategy directly. Quora's outsized commitment to data is visible in everything we do, from our rigor-driven experimentation processes to the backgrounds of our leaders (including many Product Managers and the Head of Product being former full-time data scientists). With this emphasis on data and empirics, we aim to balance rigor and pragmatism, searching for scrappy solutions in pursuit of our mission. In joining Quora's strong data team, you'll both benefit from and work to advance our culture of rational decision making.




About The Role




As a data scientist in ads, you'll work closely with sales leadership, product managers, and engineers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, build visualizations, design randomized controlled experiments, and tackle hard, open-ended problems that uncover usage patterns and opportunities for the company. In this role, you will deliver data-driven insights to guide our business strategy and extract untapped value in our platform by developing a deep understanding of our advertisers and users. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. For more about our work, see Quora's Data blog at https://quoradata.quora.com/ .




Responsibilities




Extract actionable insights from broad, open-ended questions to influence sales and product strategy and drive roadmap decisions
Analyze data to understand the root causes of metric movements and uncover growth opportunities
Design and evaluate A/B tests to make informed recommendations on product changes
Develop metrics and create dashboards to orient the direction of business development and track the success of the business
Communicate insights and recommendations to key partners
Improve the work of other data scientists through mentorship, tool development, and by bringing good industry practices to the team


Minimum Qualifications:




Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time). Learn why here
B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in a quantitative field
2+ years work experience in sales analytics, product analytics, or data science at a consumer tech company (e.g. open-ended analyses, metric development, A/B testing)
Proficiency in using SQL and procedural programming languages (e.g. Python, R) to manipulate and analyze data
Familiarity with theoretical foundations of statistical techniques (e.g. hypothesis testing, regression)
Demonstrated ability to exercise judgment and combine quantitative skills with intuition to translate numbers into insights
Demonstrated ability to clearly explain data results to cross-functional teams


Preferred Qualifications:




4+ years work experience in sales analytics, product analytics, or data science at a consumer tech company (e.g. open-ended analyses, metric development, A/B testing)
Experience evangelizing best practices and process improvements on your team
Experience working with large data sets and distributed computing tools (e.g. Presto, Redshift)
Experience pushing code and navigating a complex codebase
Active Quora user with curiosity about the product

About Social Standards:

Why are face mask sales exploding? Which craft beer brands are gaining popularity in the Midwest? What are consumers looking for in vodka? Which benefits & concerns are driving specific demographics toward plant-based meats? Is hard seltzer here to stay? A businesses’ ability to understand the answers to these types of questions before it’s too late is the key to whether they succeed or fail.

Here’s the good news: The answers to these questions and many more just like them can be found by examining the world’s largest unfiltered data set, social media. Each day, millions of people all over the world post about their interactions with brands and products, giving us a unique and authentic perspective on consumer behaviors and attitudes.

The bad news: Many social tools are not equipped to deliver clear and actionable answers to these questions. To gain an understanding of these posts, most brands currently use traditional social listening methods. Their ability to answer the questions falls short as social listening analysis is limited in its comparative capabilities.

The industry has been in search of a tool that can structure the world’s largest unfiltered data set in an easy-to-use comparative analytics platform. Enter Social Standards.

Social Standards has developed an industry-defining consumer research platform that harnesses the power of collective intelligence to deliver deep insights on consumer conversational data. The platform provides a powerful alternative data set that supplements market and investment analysis by driving a quant-based understanding of consumer motivations and market direction.

The platform is a first-to-market tool which structures the massive set of unfiltered conversational data derived from social channels into market vertical-based ontological relationships. These structured data sets are accessed through an intuitive, multi-screen interface – enabling true comparative analytics and relational mapping, and allowing the user to dive deeply into the consumer conversation.

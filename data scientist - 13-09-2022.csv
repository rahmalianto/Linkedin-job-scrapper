From your first day at Roku, you’ll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We’re a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.

Data may or may not be the new oil, but it sure is essential to a company like ours.

About The Role

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV and continues to innovate and lead the industry. While we are well-positioned to help shape the future of television – including TV advertising – around the world, continued success relies on its investment in our data.

At Roku, data is at the center of everything we do. At Roku’s scale, the depth and richness of our data help us uncover insights to improve our users' everyday experience. That’s why we’re actively looking for a Data Scientist (University Grad) to leverage big data, generating the insights that fuel Roku’s most significant business decisions to play an instrumental role within the Devices & CoreOS product analytics team.

Data Scientists use a combination of technical skills, business intuition, and analytical thinking to partner with business stakeholders and provide actionable recommendations. We expect you to play an instrumental role in helping Roku to continue its success by providing insightful segmentation, analysis of platform and behavioral trends, and A|B testing. More than having strong technical abilities to retrieve, manipulate, analyze, and visualize data and excellent communication capabilities. One of the key requirements of the role is to collaborate with stakeholders and satisfies immediate business needs. The Data Scientists role at Roku is a perfect fit for anyone who wants to continue to evolve business domain expertise alongside technical and analytical development.

As a Data Scientist (University Grad), you’ll be expected to look at what exists and find ways to make it better. We’re always in “build mode” because we’re a company of data-focused builders, especially on the data team.

What You’ll Be Doing

Use Roku’s enriched datasets to perform thorough analyses
Assist new product launches
Develop data visualizations that illustrate complex platform phenomena using Looker, Tableau, etc.
Partner with leadership, engineers, product managers, and data engineers to understand business needs and how these can be addressed through analytics
Use creativity to find proxies where verbatim data or measurement is unavailable
Identify new applications for the myriad logged events in Roku’s immense data catalog

We’re excited if you have

Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Analytics, earned in Spring 2022, or no earlier than Spring 2021
Command of SQL and experience working with Big Data
Experience in R or Python
A/B test experience

Hear from one of our analytics leaders

Or hear directly from dozens of our Roku staff around the world.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

We invest with purpose – and that’s how we’ve become a global market leader. Here, we grow by doing the right thing for the people we serve. And so can you.

We want to make success accessible to everyone. This is our opportunity. Let’s make it count.

Inclusion Statement

Vanguard’s continued commitment to diversity and inclusion is firmly rooted in our culture. Every decision we make to best serve our clients, crew (internally employees are referred to as crew), and communities is guided by one simple statement: “Do the right thing.”

We believe that a critical aspect of doing the right thing requires building diverse, inclusive, and highly effective teams of individuals who are as unique as the clients they serve. We empower our crew to contribute their distinct strengths to achieving Vanguard’s core purpose through our values.

When all crew members feel valued and included, our ability to collaborate and innovate is amplified, and we are united in delivering on Vanguard's core purpose.

Our core purpose: To take a stand for all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success.

Future of Work

During the pandemic, we transitioned to a work from home model for the majority of our crew and we continue to interview, hire, and on-board future crew remotely.

As we have developed the path forward, we have taken a thoughtful approach that both maximizes the advantages of working remotely and the many benefits of coming together and collaborating in a shared workspace. We believe that in-person interactions among our crew are important for preserving our unique culture and advantageous for the personal development of our crew.

When our Crew return to the office, many will work in our hybrid model. A smaller proportion of our crew will operate in the Work from Home work model (for example, field sales crew); or in the Work from Office model (for example, portfolio managers).

The working model that your role falls into will be communicated to you in the interview process – please do ask if you are unsure. We encourage you to make the decision regarding your job interview and offer knowing which model your role will fall into. We will test and learn as our ways of working evolve and will continue to evaluate working models along the way.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

We take the best of data science and behavioral science, and then deploy science-based strategies broadly and to specific people. We don’t settle for the status quo. We focus on growth and execution and find people who continuously seek to understand why something works. Whether it’s a deeper dive into results (a word you’ll hear around here quite often) with data or a look into what’s driving consumer decisions with behavioral science, we constantly push for the next level of knowledge and performance for our clients.




Limetree is nimble and dynamic with established success and a strong growth curve.

Limetree is a behavioral marketing company with a goal to create solutions that unite data and behavioral science to define the new standard in marketing performance. Are you curious about what makes “great marketing” that goes out according to all those models you might be building? Do you wonder if marketers and leaders know what makes creative “great” and how it could be made “better”? You might “test and learn” on your creative, but do you even know if you’re testing and learning in the right direction? How should marketing change when re-purposing to new geographies? Answering these questions, across all phases of a customer’s lifecycle, are at the core of Limetree’s mission.




Limetree is looking to expand our team with a product-centered Data Scientist to help us extract human insights from data…insights that inform the communications that go to our clients for marketing, retention, and other communication. We expect our Data Scientists to challenge themselves to unlock data supporting great marketing (the who and the when) – that supports and enhances great creative (the what). We deliver creative that uses science, not guesswork, to get and improve results.




If you’re interested in how consumers engage with communication, how we can test and match communication to individuals, and if you have a strong problem-solving ability, statistical and data analysis experience, we’d like to hear from you!




Responsibilities




Take over, extend, and enhance market management models such as creative matching, explanatory analysis, and market sizing
Contribute to the linking of behavioral marketing features through new and existing model improvement
Actively assist with and champion the movement of mature models into our Goldminer™ framework for production model execution

Interpret and analyze business opportunities and problems with data
Test performance of data-driven actions
Create and build predictive models and analytic systems

0-3 Years of proven experience as a Data Scientist or similar role
Experience building predictive models
BS or strong background in Statistics, Bioinformatics, Engineering, Mathematics, or Computer Science
Experience working with public and private data sets
Fluency with SQL and Relational Databases like Snowflake or PostgreSQL
Familiarity with scaled distributed big data tools such as dask, Hadoop, or similar
Have a good work ethic, a desire to be efficient, learn and be challenged, and be self-driven and motivated
Excellent written and verbal communication skills

Our products enable businesses to understand their customers, generate demand, act on intent, and increase conversions all the way down the funnel. Today, Clearbit powers more than 1,500 B2B companies including Asana, Segment, and Atlassian.

Are you a data scientist with aspirations of transitioning into product management? Clearbit Product Management is looking for an exceptional, passionate and customer-centric data scientist to own modeling and experimentation for one of our most valuable products - Clearbit Reveal. This is the ideal role for someone with a strong understanding of data, analytics and machine learning that would like to remain close to our data products while honing their product management skills and experience. The ideal product data scientist leverages data to design and deploy data/model tests and experiments to improve the value our customers receive from Clearbit’s products. This position is remote as Clearbit has fully transitioned into a 100% remote work environment.

As a Data Scientist at Clearbit you'll be joining a growing, impactful Product team to shape the future of Clearbit as we scale. You’ll manage the Reveal product, including running tests and experiments to improve model/algorithm accuracy. You’ll balance trade-offs between different possible machine learning algorithms or rules-based heuristics. You’ll communicate between a team of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and external stakeholders while prioritizing product roadmap and priorities that support broader company objectives and priorities.

What you will do:

As a Data Scientist (Product) at Clearbit, you will own data modeling and experimentation for Clearbit’s products.
Data science and product algorithms. Leverage product data to amplify product development. Apply data science techniques, data engineering processes, and experimentation tests to improve model accuracy.
Testing and experimentation. Apply techniques to evaluate live product data and modeled output. Design and execute various A/B and multivariate tests to shape the next iteration of the product. Evaluate the output captured in statistical analyses and translate them into insights to inform product decisions and execute product improvements.
Customer discovery and interviews. Connect with customers on an ongoing basis to clearly understand their needs and challenges. Validate ideas with customers and analyze the data to seek out the right products and strategies Clearbit should pursue.
Product requirements. Define both functional and non-functional product requirements of our AI/ML-powered solutions while being hyper-focused in solving real customer problems.
Own a pillar product roadmap. Develop a product roadmap that focuses on and prioritizes those investments that will help us achieve our overarching objectives and key results (OKRs).
Cross-functional Collaboration. Partner with teams across Clearbit to tackle customer problems. Collaborate with Design, Engineering, Sales, Product, Customer Success and others to rapidly conceptualize, prototype, market validate and launch new product ideas and innovations. Communicate both the business and technical rationale behind your decisions, with the proper fidelity needed for a given audience: customer success, product development, leadership, and customers.
Communicate and bring ideas to life. Understand and articulate common, foundational customer problems, collaborate and coordinate with internal teams and leadership, assist in go-to-market strategies, and do whatever it takes to bring an idea to life and deliver value for our customers.


What you need to succeed:

You have practical data science experience. You have significant prior success as a Data, Product, or Decision Scientist working on challenging problems at scale with expertise in statistical modeling and/ or machine learning.
You have the required technical skills. You have experience in advanced analytics and statistics, SQL/NoSQL, Python, R, machine learning, experiment design (A/B testing, multivariate analysis), Data Wrangling/ETL, and APIs.
You have a growth mindset. You are looking to grow your career and product management experience. You can be mentored and are eager to learn agile/SCRUM product development processes and principles.
Your focus is on customer value and experience. You recognize that we can build anything but it's figuring out the right thing to build for customers—and truly understanding their challenges and problems they face—that matters most.
You're creative and curious. You can dream and brainstorm and explore the opposite perspective. You're not afraid of new or different ideas.
Technical challenges aren't scary. You've worked with complex systems, data, APIs, CRMs, and/or marketing or sales automation platforms.
You have excellent communication skills. You're as comfortable writing for and talking to customers as you are talking to leadership, design, and engineering. You know your audiences, what's important to them, and can tailor the message so it's concise and clear. You can break down complex concepts into common, easy-to-understand language for the business.
Your attention-to-detail is top notch. You're quick to catch pitfalls and potential issues, and aren't afraid to ask why or communicate your understanding of a situation. You ensure everyone is aligned and understands what matters and why.


Working at Clearbit:

We invest in personal and team growth, valuing constructive feedback, and emotional intelligence. We aim to maintain a working environment of psychological safety, where vulnerability is not a weakness, so that it's easier to take creative risks, re-define what’s possible, and grow into the best version of yourself. Your teammates will push you to grow (kindly) and ask for the same in return.
Building a company takes a physical and mental toll, which is why we think it's incredibly important to make sure that we provide benefits that focus on physical and mental health.
Our benefits include:- Competitive salary and meaningful equity- Health, dental, and vision for you and your family- Paid parental leave- Mental health resources, coaching and therapy sessions- 401(K)- Education benefits


Don’t meet 100% of the criteria, but think you can do the job? We’d love to chat anyway! We’re on a mission to build diverse teams, and studies have shown that women and folks from marginalized communities are less likely to apply to jobs if they don’t check every box.

We value and celebrate how you identify, who you love, the color of your skin, your age (at heart and on paper), the gods you do or don't believe in, and every other belief and characteristic that make you, YOU. The more inclusive we are, the better we — and our work — will be.

Clearbit is an equal opportunity employer.

CarMax, the way your career should be!




About This Job




Disrupting the marketplace more than 25 years ago, CarMax became the largest used car retailer in the US. However, our goals as a company aren't just to be the best in the industry but a leading retailer across all industries.




Our pricing and inventory systems team work to accurately value the unique characteristics of each individual car that we buy or sell and allocate those vehicles across our 200+ stores. Last year alone, CarMax sold more than 1 million vehicles, appraised over 2 million vehicles, and had $150m in weekly auto auction spend - all while dealing with constantly changing consumer demand, wholesale auction supply, and other market conditions that are often regionally differentiated.




To realize the full value of our models, our systems experts must accurately and instantaneously deliver thousands of recommendations to our field associates daily. This requires the combination of a deep understanding of our models, the quantitative and technical skills to deploy new models as robust and stable systems, and the results focus and analytical ability to quickly diagnose and fix problems.




Essential Responsibilities




Collaborate with our pricing algorithm modeling experts to rapidly deploy newly developed models
Leverage strong computer science and software engineering skills to build software that: a) calculates the optimal value for each vehicle and b) serves as a data pipeline to field associates in seconds
Develop and execute a management system that ensures the right value is put on every vehicle every day
Ensure that new code deployments are stable and align with intent through unit testing
Build automated monitoring and alert systems to ensure that production models are delivering intended values
Quickly respond to and resolve pricing system issues
Partner with CarMax Technology to evolve system infrastructure to support our business and data science needs
Communicate how our systems work within and outside of the team, both at a general level and a detailed level




Qualifications And Requirements




Ability to consistently deliver at a high level on the responsibilities listed above
Degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, or related field




Requirements listed below are representative of the knowledge and skills required:




Mathematical, modeling, and reasoning skills to understand complex pricing models and deploy them accurately
Computer programming skills to integrate new models into our existing framework
Experience/familiarity with our exciting technology suite (Azure, Python, R, SQL, Teradata, etc.) and to explore new technologies to enhance our data science capabilities
Strong communication and teamwork to deliver clear and consistent messaging




Interviewing Process




Due to COVID-19, most of our employees are working from home. We've implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by phone or video. We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we're all in this together.




Upon an applicant's request, CarMax will consider reasonable accommodation to complete the CarMax Job Application.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Summary:




The Model Analysis Group (MAG) is a growing team within Risk Modeling and Analytics (RMA) . It is responsible for all post model development analytics related to models developed by RMA teams, including Ongoing Performance Assessments (OPA), Annual Model Reviews (AMR), and Revalidations.




Members of the MAG will be actively involved in different aspects of the model lifecycle. A typical model goes through different stages: design, calibration, testing, documentation, validation, implementation, monitoring and back to re-design and re-calibration when relevant assumptions change or monitoring indicates performance issues. OPAs and AMRs are critical stages of the model lifecycle to determine model performance (model use and monitoring) that can trigger model re-design or re-calibration by identifying critical issues.




Thus the job is related to a critical stage/decision point; essentially whether or not the model can still be used, which in turn has a material impact on resources, timelines, and deliverables.




Key mandates also include driving productivity enhancements in Model Analysis through innovation. The MAG will leverage cutting edge software and technology to reimagine the way we currently execute on this crucial phase of the model lifecycle, to the benefit of our partners, including model sponsors, developers, and Model Risk Management.




As the MAG spans all RMA models, members of the MAG will have the opportunity to become well-versed in multiple risk stripes, with such skills training enhancing their mobility and growth potential within RMA and the larger Risk organization.




The position will work very closely with others in the MAG, including the Head of MAG who reports to the head of RMA. RMA develops risk analytics for use by Risk, Finance and Product and Client Coverage teams on a global basis. The head of RMA reports to the Finance Chief Risk Officer.
Key responsibilities:




Stakeholders include various working groups, model developers, risk managers, business clients, model validators, internal and external auditors, and regulators. Engage with stakeholders accordingly to:
Develop and implement methodologies, algorithms and diagnostic tools for testing model robustness, stability, reliability, performance and quality control of modelling data.
Conduct on-going model performance analysis (OPAs), annual model reviews (AMRs) , and revalidations.
Discover, understand and quantify model limitations
Provide comprehensive interpretations, explanations and conclusions
Work with partners to resolve model issues
Enhance efficiency and effectiveness of implementation of post model development analytics.
Automate and consolidate ongoing model analysis and the annual model review process across different models
Migrate analytics to a production environment as appropriate
Support various tasks in response to regulatory and internal risk management requirements.
Develop, maintain and enhance technical documentation including project plans, model descriptions, mathematical derivations, data analysis, process and quality controls.
Education:
A PhD or Master’s in a technical discipline ( e.g. physics, mathematics, statistics, engineering, economics, financial engineering, operational research or similar).
Qualifications:
4+ years of experience in a comparable quantitative modeling or analytics role, ideally in the financial sector. Fewer years of experience will be considered with advanced degrees. Postdoctoral researchers are encouraged to apply.
Solid programming skills and experience with statistical data analysis, modelling techniques and numerical implementations. More specifically experience in Python Data Science Stack (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter and IPython), R, Shell Scripts, UNIX, VBA, C/C++ (basic knowledge), SAS, Version Controlling (Git/Bitbucket) and basic database skills in either Oracle or Sybase/SQL .You may at least have experience in three of these techniques.
Experience in developing and maintaining detailed technical documentation for models, model validation, project plans and processes preferred (Experience in scientific research paper writing will be an added advantage ).
Strong written and verbal communication skills, and ability to discuss technical issues with stakeholders.
Ability to meet deadlines for product deliverables in a timely, proactive and entrepreneurial manor.
Demonstrated project management and organizational skills and capability to handle multiple projects at one time.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

This role is the first of its kind on the Research team! At DoorDash, Data Scientists typically report into the Analytics function, but this role will partner with and be a fully fledged member of the Research team! You may have worked with Research partners in the past (sometimes called UX Research or Product Research), but, if not, here is what we do:




At DoorDash, researchers are a part of Product org along with product managers and designers. We define success as our ability to impact product and company strategy, particularly by driving the creation of amazing experiences for our three core audiences - Merchants, Dashers, and Customers. We employ both qualitative (e.g., ethnography, in-depth interviews, focus groups etc.) and quantitative (e.g., surveys, experiments, eye-tracking etc.) research methods to gather data from which we then triangulate insights that inspire innovation. The Research team is at an exciting stage - growing, but still early enough where you will be able to shape the team culture and processes from the ground up, while at the same time, guiding the company to bigger and bolder new bets. This is particularly true for this role, where you will establish the foundation for the partnership between the Research and Analytics functions to inform business strategy. Your scope will be broad and your autonomy will be high.




About The Role




As a Research Data Scientist at DoorDash, you will use your quantitative background to dive into large datasets to generate insights that guide decision making. In this particular role, you will do that in partnership with the Research team. While the current team mostly specializes in methods typical of advanced social scientists, you will bring a new lens to insights discovery with your unique skill set. This role will cover all three audiences in order to allow for the greatest impact. Like our Researcher and Senior Researcher roles, your work portfolio will consist of a mix between strategic and tactical initiatives.




Here are three examples, from strategic to tactical:




We are interested in exploring the mechanisms behind new restaurant discovery. Research shows that different types of customers are drawn to different mixes of information depending on both factors like personal interests and context. Can you help us explore deeper behavioral differences between these discovery cohorts in order to influence UX and recommendation algorithms?
You notice an unexplainable drop off in a sign up funnel and seek out a research partner to explore why it is happening. How can you use triangulated data to inspire new product experiences that drive conversion?
We’ve observed in qual that five participants used search to find content that was not visible on the homepage. What is the actual opportunity size of this behavior in search logs?
We need to reach out to a specific and unique audience so we can send them a survey. Can you help us pull a list of eligible audience members that match particular behavioral criteria so the research operations function can contact them?




You’re Excited About This Opportunity Because You Will…




Work alongside expert research leads to bring a unique data-driven perspective to product and business insight
Use quantitative analysis and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand what drives our business
Provide insights to help business and product leaders understand marketplace dynamics, user behaviors, and long-term trends
Produce recommendations and use statistical techniques and hypothesis testing to validate your findings
Identify and measure levers to help move essential metrics and make recommendations




We’re Excited About You Because You Have…




A degree in Math, Physics, Statistics, Economics, Computer Science, or similar domain
3+ years of experience in analytics, data science, consulting, or related quantitative role. Experience working in a Research function is not required, but a nice to have.
Experience working with funnel optimization, user segmentation, cohort analyses, time series analyses, regression models, etc
Expertise with SQL queries, ETL, A/B Testing, and statistical analysis (e.g. hypothesis testing, experimentation, regressions) with statistical packages, such as Matlab, R, SAS or Python
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Chartio, Looker, Tableau)
The insight to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way
A passion for solving user needs and pain points for all of our audiences
The determination to initiate and lead tactical and strategic projects to completion in a scrappy, fast-paced, and dynamic environment




About DoorDash




At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.




DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.




Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion




We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at DoorDash. We value a diverse workforce – people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply.

This role is the first of its kind on the Research team! At DoorDash, Data Scientists typically report into the Analytics function, but this role will partner with and be a fully fledged member of the Research team! You may have worked with Research partners in the past (sometimes called UX Research or Product Research), but, if not, here is what we do:




At DoorDash, researchers are a part of Product org along with product managers and designers. We define success as our ability to impact product and company strategy, particularly by driving the creation of amazing experiences for our three core audiences - Merchants, Dashers, and Customers. We employ both qualitative (e.g., ethnography, in-depth interviews, focus groups etc.) and quantitative (e.g., surveys, experiments, eye-tracking etc.) research methods to gather data from which we then triangulate insights that inspire innovation. The Research team is at an exciting stage - growing, but still early enough where you will be able to shape the team culture and processes from the ground up, while at the same time, guiding the company to bigger and bolder new bets. This is particularly true for this role, where you will establish the foundation for the partnership between the Research and Analytics functions to inform business strategy. Your scope will be broad and your autonomy will be high.




About The Role




As a Research Data Scientist at DoorDash, you will use your quantitative background to dive into large datasets to generate insights that guide decision making. In this particular role, you will do that in partnership with the Research team. While the current team mostly specializes in methods typical of advanced social scientists, you will bring a new lens to insights discovery with your unique skill set. This role will cover all three audiences in order to allow for the greatest impact. Like our Researcher and Senior Researcher roles, your work portfolio will consist of a mix between strategic and tactical initiatives.




Here are three examples, from strategic to tactical:




We are interested in exploring the mechanisms behind new restaurant discovery. Research shows that different types of customers are drawn to different mixes of information depending on both factors like personal interests and context. Can you help us explore deeper behavioral differences between these discovery cohorts in order to influence UX and recommendation algorithms?
You notice an unexplainable drop off in a sign up funnel and seek out a research partner to explore why it is happening. How can you use triangulated data to inspire new product experiences that drive conversion?
We’ve observed in qual that five participants used search to find content that was not visible on the homepage. What is the actual opportunity size of this behavior in search logs?
We need to reach out to a specific and unique audience so we can send them a survey. Can you help us pull a list of eligible audience members that match particular behavioral criteria so the research operations function can contact them?




You’re Excited About This Opportunity Because You Will…




Work alongside expert research leads to bring a unique data-driven perspective to product and business insight
Use quantitative analysis and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand what drives our business
Provide insights to help business and product leaders understand marketplace dynamics, user behaviors, and long-term trends
Produce recommendations and use statistical techniques and hypothesis testing to validate your findings
Identify and measure levers to help move essential metrics and make recommendations




We’re Excited About You Because You Have…




A degree in Math, Physics, Statistics, Economics, Computer Science, or similar domain
3+ years of experience in analytics, data science, consulting, or related quantitative role. Experience working in a Research function is not required, but a nice to have.
Experience working with funnel optimization, user segmentation, cohort analyses, time series analyses, regression models, etc
Expertise with SQL queries, ETL, A/B Testing, and statistical analysis (e.g. hypothesis testing, experimentation, regressions) with statistical packages, such as Matlab, R, SAS or Python
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Chartio, Looker, Tableau)
The insight to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way
A passion for solving user needs and pain points for all of our audiences
The determination to initiate and lead tactical and strategic projects to completion in a scrappy, fast-paced, and dynamic environment




About DoorDash




At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.




DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

When our Crew return to the office, many will work in our hybrid model. A smaller proportion of our crew will operate in the Work from Home work model (for example, field sales crew); or in the Work from Office model (for example, portfolio managers).

The working model that your role falls into will be communicated to you in the interview process – please do ask if you are unsure. We encourage you to make the decision regarding your job interview and offer knowing which model your role will fall into. We will test and learn as our ways of working evolve and will continue to evaluate working models along the way.

This role is the first of its kind on the Research team! At DoorDash, Data Scientists typically report into the Analytics function, but this role will partner with and be a fully fledged member of the Research team! You may have worked with Research partners in the past (sometimes called UX Research or Product Research), but, if not, here is what we do:




At DoorDash, researchers are a part of Product org along with product managers and designers. We define success as our ability to impact product and company strategy, particularly by driving the creation of amazing experiences for our three core audiences - Merchants, Dashers, and Customers. We employ both qualitative (e.g., ethnography, in-depth interviews, focus groups etc.) and quantitative (e.g., surveys, experiments, eye-tracking etc.) research methods to gather data from which we then triangulate insights that inspire innovation. The Research team is at an exciting stage - growing, but still early enough where you will be able to shape the team culture and processes from the ground up, while at the same time, guiding the company to bigger and bolder new bets. This is particularly true for this role, where you will establish the foundation for the partnership between the Research and Analytics functions to inform business strategy. Your scope will be broad and your autonomy will be high.




About The Role




As a Research Data Scientist at DoorDash, you will use your quantitative background to dive into large datasets to generate insights that guide decision making. In this particular role, you will do that in partnership with the Research team. While the current team mostly specializes in methods typical of advanced social scientists, you will bring a new lens to insights discovery with your unique skill set. This role will cover all three audiences in order to allow for the greatest impact. Like our Researcher and Senior Researcher roles, your work portfolio will consist of a mix between strategic and tactical initiatives.




Here are three examples, from strategic to tactical:




We are interested in exploring the mechanisms behind new restaurant discovery. Research shows that different types of customers are drawn to different mixes of information depending on both factors like personal interests and context. Can you help us explore deeper behavioral differences between these discovery cohorts in order to influence UX and recommendation algorithms?
You notice an unexplainable drop off in a sign up funnel and seek out a research partner to explore why it is happening. How can you use triangulated data to inspire new product experiences that drive conversion?
We’ve observed in qual that five participants used search to find content that was not visible on the homepage. What is the actual opportunity size of this behavior in search logs?
We need to reach out to a specific and unique audience so we can send them a survey. Can you help us pull a list of eligible audience members that match particular behavioral criteria so the research operations function can contact them?




You’re Excited About This Opportunity Because You Will…




Work alongside expert research leads to bring a unique data-driven perspective to product and business insight
Use quantitative analysis and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand what drives our business
Provide insights to help business and product leaders understand marketplace dynamics, user behaviors, and long-term trends
Produce recommendations and use statistical techniques and hypothesis testing to validate your findings
Identify and measure levers to help move essential metrics and make recommendations




We’re Excited About You Because You Have…




A degree in Math, Physics, Statistics, Economics, Computer Science, or similar domain
3+ years of experience in analytics, data science, consulting, or related quantitative role. Experience working in a Research function is not required, but a nice to have.
Experience working with funnel optimization, user segmentation, cohort analyses, time series analyses, regression models, etc
Expertise with SQL queries, ETL, A/B Testing, and statistical analysis (e.g. hypothesis testing, experimentation, regressions) with statistical packages, such as Matlab, R, SAS or Python
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Chartio, Looker, Tableau)
The insight to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way
A passion for solving user needs and pain points for all of our audiences
The determination to initiate and lead tactical and strategic projects to completion in a scrappy, fast-paced, and dynamic environment




About DoorDash




At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.




DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at DoorDash. We value a diverse workforce – people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. Thank you to the Level Playing Field Institute for this statement of non-discrimination.

This role is the first of its kind on the Research team! At DoorDash, Data Scientists typically report into the Analytics function, but this role will partner with and be a fully fledged member of the Research team! You may have worked with Research partners in the past (sometimes called UX Research or Product Research), but, if not, here is what we do:




At DoorDash, researchers are a part of Product org along with product managers and designers. We define success as our ability to impact product and company strategy, particularly by driving the creation of amazing experiences for our three core audiences - Merchants, Dashers, and Customers. We employ both qualitative (e.g., ethnography, in-depth interviews, focus groups etc.) and quantitative (e.g., surveys, experiments, eye-tracking etc.) research methods to gather data from which we then triangulate insights that inspire innovation. The Research team is at an exciting stage - growing, but still early enough where you will be able to shape the team culture and processes from the ground up, while at the same time, guiding the company to bigger and bolder new bets. This is particularly true for this role, where you will establish the foundation for the partnership between the Research and Analytics functions to inform business strategy. Your scope will be broad and your autonomy will be high.




About The Role




As a Research Data Scientist at DoorDash, you will use your quantitative background to dive into large datasets to generate insights that guide decision making. In this particular role, you will do that in partnership with the Research team. While the current team mostly specializes in methods typical of advanced social scientists, you will bring a new lens to insights discovery with your unique skill set. This role will cover all three audiences in order to allow for the greatest impact. Like our Researcher and Senior Researcher roles, your work portfolio will consist of a mix between strategic and tactical initiatives.




Here are three examples, from strategic to tactical:




We are interested in exploring the mechanisms behind new restaurant discovery. Research shows that different types of customers are drawn to different mixes of information depending on both factors like personal interests and context. Can you help us explore deeper behavioral differences between these discovery cohorts in order to influence UX and recommendation algorithms?
You notice an unexplainable drop off in a sign up funnel and seek out a research partner to explore why it is happening. How can you use triangulated data to inspire new product experiences that drive conversion?
We’ve observed in qual that five participants used search to find content that was not visible on the homepage. What is the actual opportunity size of this behavior in search logs?
We need to reach out to a specific and unique audience so we can send them a survey. Can you help us pull a list of eligible audience members that match particular behavioral criteria so the research operations function can contact them?




You’re Excited About This Opportunity Because You Will…




Work alongside expert research leads to bring a unique data-driven perspective to product and business insight
Use quantitative analysis and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand what drives our business
Provide insights to help business and product leaders understand marketplace dynamics, user behaviors, and long-term trends
Produce recommendations and use statistical techniques and hypothesis testing to validate your findings
Identify and measure levers to help move essential metrics and make recommendations




We’re Excited About You Because You Have…




A degree in Math, Physics, Statistics, Economics, Computer Science, or similar domain
3+ years of experience in analytics, data science, consulting, or related quantitative role. Experience working in a Research function is not required, but a nice to have.
Experience working with funnel optimization, user segmentation, cohort analyses, time series analyses, regression models, etc
Expertise with SQL queries, ETL, A/B Testing, and statistical analysis (e.g. hypothesis testing, experimentation, regressions) with statistical packages, such as Matlab, R, SAS or Python
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Chartio, Looker, Tableau)
The insight to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way
A passion for solving user needs and pain points for all of our audiences
The determination to initiate and lead tactical and strategic projects to completion in a scrappy, fast-paced, and dynamic environment




About DoorDash




At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.




DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at DoorDash. We value a diverse workforce – people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. Thank you to the Level Playing Field Institute for this statement of non-discrimination.
